## Initial Set Up

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

## ANPP

```{r}
# load in 2018 ANPP data
ANPP_df <- read_csv(here("data","ANPP.csv"))

# sum ANPP data for each individual quadrat
### CHECK WITH SETH - there is some mis-alignment with his data workup, which seems to be from ANT plot 2 listed as both control and water?
ANPP_by_quadrat <- ANPP_df |>
  group_by(Site, Treatment, Plot, Quadrat) |>
  summarize(Quad_mass = sum(Mass, na.rm=TRUE))

# reduce ANPP data to means for each quadrat
### CHECK WITH SETH - not all plot have two quadrats. Not always four replicate plots per treatment x site combination (sometimes there are 3, sometimes there are 5). Note that there should be only 4 plot reps per treatment. 
ANPP_by_plot <- ANPP_by_quadrat |>
  group_by(Site, Treatment, Plot) |>
  summarize(Plot_mass = mean(Quad_mass, na.rm=TRUE),
            N_quads    = count(Site))

# reduce ANPP data to means for site x treatment combination
ANPP_by_trt <- ANPP_by_plot |>
  group_by(Site, Treatment) |>
  summarize(Plot_mass = mean(Plot_mass, na.rm=TRUE))
```

## Root Biomass

```{r}
