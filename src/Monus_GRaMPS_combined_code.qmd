## Initial Set Up

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

## ANPP

```{r}
# load in 2018 ANPP data
ANPP_df <- read_csv(here("data","ANPP.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)

# Change treatment names to align with Monus data sets
ANPP_df <- ANPP_df |>
    mutate(
    Treatment = as.factor(Treatment) |> 
      recode_factor(C = "Ctrl", D = "Exl", W = "Add"))

# calculate canopy cover for each Observation 
# From Seth "To calculate total vegetation cover per quadrat, multiply the canopy cover value by the count, then sum all these products for every species in the quadrat....It sounds like Brittney used plot as a level of replication, so could take average of the 2 quadrats in each plot. "
ANPP_df <- ANPP_df |>
    mutate(
    Canopy_coverXcount = Canopy_cover * Count)

# sum Canopy_coverXcount and ANPP for each species within individual quadrats
# note that per HT's conversation (2024-03-27) with SM, ANPP already has 'count' taken into account, no need to multiple it
ANPP_by_spp_by_quadrat <- ANPP_df |>
  group_by(Site, Treatment, Plot, Quadrat, Species) |>
  summarize(
    CanopyCoverBySpp = sum(Canopy_coverXcount, na.rm=TRUE),

## Root Biomass

```{r}

                                                      Root_mass_lower),
              names_sep = "_")

# Add core depths together 
# Calculate roots biomass in units of g m-2, based on the 7 cm diameter corer
root_biomass_wide_df <- root_biomass_wide_df |>
    mutate(
    Root_mass_Can = Root_mass_upper_Can + Root_mass_lower_Can,

## Combined ANPP and Root Biomass
